# Conclusion

## Recap of the Week

This week we looked at how to add new assets (ones you created or ones you found) and apply existing scripts to them.  This allowed us to focus on the design of our game and not worry about the programming aspect as much.  In this way, we can hone in on our game play while taking note of any limitations that these existing scripts might have.

## Next Week

Next week, we will dive into Beginning Scripting.  Don't worry; we will have fun!
