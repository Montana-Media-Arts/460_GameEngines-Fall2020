# Painting a Level

The 2D Game Kit uses Unity’s Tilemap feature, which is designed to help you draw out a level quickly and easily. The Kit has everything set up for you, so you can get started straight away.  You have already seen this, so it should be old hat now!

Let’s start designing a level:
In the top menu, go to Window > 2D > Tile Palette


The Tile Palette window looks like this:

We have created two Tile Palettes that allow you to draw out levels. These tiles use the Scriptable Tile system of the Unity Tilemap. They automatically choose the right sprite for a platform. We have two styles of sprites: Grassy Rocks and Alien Structure.
We need to make sure the correct set of tiles is selected in Tile Palette;
Click the Tile Palette Menu
Select Tileset_Gamekit
Pick the type of tile you like best for your level

Now let’s paint some tiles in the scene to create a level;
Click on a tile in the Tile Palette to select it
Navigate to the Scene View
Left-click and drag to draw your level
If you make a mistake, you can hold Shift and left-click or drag to erase Tiles.
