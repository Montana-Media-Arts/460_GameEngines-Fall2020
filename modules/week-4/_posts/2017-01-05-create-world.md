# Create a World

## Create a new Scene

1. Duplicate the Blank Scene and rename it to something else.

2. Look at the TileMap Palette - Window - 2D - Tile Palette.

3. Make sure the Active Tilemap is chosen and match the Object in the Hierarchy.

4. Paint some tiles onto the scense.

5. Save your Scene and press Play.

6. Press Stop.  

7. Now, create a House in the Midground.

8. Add the Roof from the Prefabs.

9. Change the Roof so that it fits over your house.

10. Change the fade effect so that it's tranparent if you go into the house.  Change the Order in Layer to 1000.

11. Add a Box Collider 2D to the Roof.  Make sure the Is Trigger is checked.

12. Add the Fading Sprite Script to the Roof.  You can search for it in the Components.

13. Feel free to add a Door and Chimney to your house - they are in the Prefabs folder as well.
