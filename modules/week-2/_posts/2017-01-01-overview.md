# Week 2 Overview

Let's review and make sure you were able to get everything up and running.  Open Unity -> Open and your Playground Project.  Were there any issues getting it installed? Finding it in the Asset store?  What other things did you install?
Take 10 minutes to discuss this in class.


This week, we are going to actually work on creating our first game.  We will use the Unity Playground to help us get started and design a fully functional game.  You won't have to worry about programming, just drag and drop.  Then, we will show each other the games we created.
